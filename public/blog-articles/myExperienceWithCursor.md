# My Experience Using Cursor in a TypeScript Project

After integrating Cursor into a TypeScript project, I wanted to share my thoughts on how it performed and what stood out.

## Overall Impression

Cursor is an impressive tool. I used its IDE, which functions as an extended version of Visual Studio Code. The setup was seamless just a quick login with my company account, and I had access to unlimited autocompletions and premium AI features.

### Key Features

There are two main features that stood out to me:

1. **Autocompletion**

   Cursor’s autocompletion is incredibly smart. As a front-end developer working in React, I noticed a significant boost in efficiency. I’d estimate it cuts coding time by a factor of 10\. For example, when introducing a new state variable, I could simply hint at its use, and Cursor would autocomplete the relevant lines and even suggest where to declare it in the useState hook.

   It also intelligently suggests Tailwind CSS classes based on context, maintaining consistency across sibling elements and layouts. Even better, it learns from your coding patterns over time drawing from your commits to provide increasingly relevant suggestions. For experienced developers, it becomes a truly helpful coding companion.

2. **⌘K (Command K)**

   This command triggers premium AI actions. You can use it to add styles, generate functions, rename variables, refactor complex code blocks, and more. It’s powerful, ideal for both routine tasks and complex challenges.

   However, it’s not a substitute for your own coding knowledge. You shouldn’t rely on it for things you don’t understand, languages you’re unfamiliar with, or for blindly generating test cases. If misused, it can lead to fragile code, so it’s important that teams and managers understand its strengths and limitations.

**Other Features**

- **Error Fixing**: You can hover over an error and ask Cursor to fix it. While it doesn’t always get it right, especially if you’re also unsure how to resolve it, it can sometimes find the correct fix surprisingly well.

- **Chat Functionality**: Cursor’s chat is great for occasional use. It’s helpful for understanding new tools, algorithms, or libraries. You can ask questions and get explanations tailored to your context.

**Final Thoughts**

I’m still learning how to use Cursor effectively. Every day, I discover new ways to interact with it, and it seems to keep adapting to how I code. It’s a powerful tool, but like any tool, its value depends on how you use it.

If you’ve tried Cursor or have thoughts on what I’ve shared, I’d love to hear your perspective, especially if you disagree with anything I’ve mentioned.

Thanks for reading,
